# Configure and Use OpenAI’s **Create GPT** for .NET Best Practices

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on how to configure and customize OpenAI’s **Create GPT** feature to align with your team’s .NET coding standards and architectural principles. By following the included steps and examples, you can ensure the model consistently produces high-quality, maintainable, and scalable .NET code.

## Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Configuration**: Learn how to access and set up **Create GPT**, define a System Message, and add examples to enforce best practices.
- **.NET-Focused System Message**: Use the provided instructions and coding patterns (e.g., Clean Architecture, repository pattern) to guide the model’s responses.
- **Practical Examples**: Implement tried-and-true code snippets and prompts covering repositories, middleware, and architectural explanations.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine your GPT based on real-world feedback, adding new examples and rules as your team’s needs evolve.
- **No Fine-Tuning Required**: Avoid the complexity and overhead of model training by configuring the model’s behavior directly through **Create GPT**.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Instructions**: Begin with the detailed guide to understand how each step influences the model’s outputs.
2. **Copy and Modify**: Use the provided System Message and examples as a starting point. Tailor them to match your team’s coding style and conventions.
3. **Test and Refine**: Run sample prompts, review the GPT’s responses, and adjust the System Message or examples to ensure alignment with your standards.
4. **Collaborate and Iterate**: Encourage team members to contribute improvements, add new examples, and share feedback.

## Contributing
